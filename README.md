# 👋 Hi, I'm Curtis

I'm a junior back end developer with a foundation in **Go**, **Python**, and **SQL** — and I'm currently looking for opportunities to join a team where I can grow, learn, and contribute.

I've been diving into backend architecture, and have been gradually expanding into cloud deployments and modern web stacks. Some of the platforms and tools I’ve started working with include:

- 🚀 **fly.io**, **Google Cloud Run**, **Vercel**
- ☁️ **AWS S3 & CloudFront**, **Supabase**

### 🔧 Recent Project
One of my main projects is **[Taday](https://github.com/curtisbraxdale/taday)** – a web app for sending personalized daily SMS agendas. It’s built with Go on the backend and designed to be fast, simple, and privacy-focused.

### 📬 Let's connect

I'm open to junior backend roles (remote or NYC-based) and excited to learn alongside experienced developers.
